Problem:

Directories get old quickly and the South Cumberland Plateau needs a better way, a new way, for public good organizations to connect. Findhelp.org is a great tool for this, but it has thousands of extra organizations that don’t truly serve the plateau that need to get sorted out in a usable way.

Background: 

The South Cumberland Health Network is an organization of about 50 organizations focused on the public good and health of the South Cumberland Plateau. They meet once a month to collaborate and attend workshops, to keep up with what is going on on the South Cumberland Plateau.
The South Cumberland Plateau has always struggled with the organization of the groups that are under it at some basic level, directories are always going out of date. Organizations have their heads down doing their work, and when they stick their heads up to work on a collaboration or a project, organizations and members have changed around them. Projects are slowed while new bonds are formed.
Searching for a way to get around this failure of flexibility that are directories, the SCHN found the website Findhelp.org, run by Aunt Bertha. Findhelp.com is a living directory where each organization can update their site to make sure it is up to date. There are two steps to create a program on Findhelp.org. Firstly, a program must be suggested. Any individual can suggest an organization, you don’t even need to be a part of the organization in general. From that suggestion, Findhelp will create a full web page for the organization. Secondly, an organization can claim their programs, and have direct control over the site that Findhelp has created for them.
Unfortunately, findhelp does have its weaknesses, it claims that even small cities like monteagle have over 1300 organizations that serve it. This number is ridiculous, but it includes every single organization in the Findhelp network that is a national program or state program that includes Tennessee. By sorting through the thousands of programs that Findhelp claims serve the Plateau, the SCHN has found the organizations that do directly serve the plateau that are on findhelp, and has organized workshops to collect any public health organizations that are not on Findhelp, and empower them to do so. Now, we plan to organize the organizations that have signed up and are local into a map available on an up and coming SCHN website.

Impact: Using this map on the site, we hope to not just have all of the organizations on Findhelp in one place, but also have it as proof of a working active directory through findhelp, one that is usable for not just the SCHN, but one for all organizations interested. A directory like this one becomes more valuable with the more buy-in given. More organizations in this online directory through advertisement means a more effective directory. A more effective directory means more organizations will be interested in being in it. We are hoping this creates enough of a positive feedback loop to help the capacity of the SCHN for years to come.

Summary:

Instructions:
To whom it may concern,
    The map is created by piping over data that was collected by Connor Stack and programmed in R through the skillful mind and hands of Pravesh Agarwal. When working with this sort of software that uses the map formatting is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Before you change the master document linked to the map, make a copy of it and stick it somewhere, so you can restore what was messed up when that inevitably happens. That way the map isn’t permanently broken.

Follow these when changing the master document or everything will break, and we don’t want that.

 Do not change any of the column headings.

State, city, and street all need to be filled in for a marker. 
When filling them in, do not put anything other than the state, city, and street in those boxes. There is geocoding software attached to them and having the map shunted somewhere the geocoder thinks it should be in some 4rth direction would not be good.

No spaces or commas at the beginning or end of any of the variables, or it will break them.
